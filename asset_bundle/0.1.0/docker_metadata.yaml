# This file updates the config.yaml by documenting a pointer to the docker container of a model for each version
# Additionally, the language used in the config.yaml was unnecessarily complicated as there are already docker primitives
# corresponding to each type of data. Below is a map of how this language was standardized/updated.
#   host => registry
#   name => repo_suffix
#   prefix => repo_prefix
#   namespace => namespace

dockerMetadata:
# The dockerMetadata is a list where the first element is the source location that the model image was originally
# uploaded to. If the image is ever migrated (exported/imported), additional entries can be added to this list in order
# to trace the movement of the image
- registry:
  repo_prefix:
  repo_suffix:


# Example of decomposing a URI in order to fill in the this information:
#
# 1234567890123.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/models/location/image-classification:0.2.0
#
# dockerRepository:
#  registry: 1234567890123.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
#  repo_prefix: models/location
#  repo_suffix: image-classification
#
# Additionally, the semantic version of the current model is required to be the image tag
#
# The id field is a randomly generated uid using 10 lowercase alphanumeric characters
