    #INPUT SPECIFICATION:
    The input(s) to this model must adhere to the following specifications:
    | Filename      | Maximum Size | Accepted Format(s) |
    | --------      | ------------ | ------------------ |

    Additional information describing input file(s) can go in a short paragraph here if necessary. Feel free to add an additional markdown table if many values need to be listed.

    #OUTPUT DETAILS:
    This model will output the following:
    | Filename      | Maximum Size | Format |
    | --------      | ------------ | ------ |

    Additional information describing the output file(s) can go in a short paragraph here. Feel free to add an additional markdown table if many values need to be listed. If you want to use an additional table, please use the following headerless format:

    |-|-|-|-|
    | Entry 1 | Entry 2 | Entry 3 | Entry 4 |
    | Entry 5 | Entry 6 | Entry 7 | Entry 8 |

  # Metrics that describe the model's performance (if no relevant metrics provide explanation why)
  # Specify which dataset these metrics were evaluated on
  performance:

# Use this format: "VERSION_NUMBER - Concise sentence describing what is new in this version of the model."
# Example: "0.0.11 - Achieves precision of 98.15%, recall of 90.61%, and F1 score of 89.72% on CoNLL-2003 validation dataset."
